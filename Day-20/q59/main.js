// QUESTION :59
// Average Score Calculator: Write a simple program that can take lots of scores and find their average.
// Explain & TIP: This program can handle any number of scores you give it, and it tells you the average score. Handy for seeing how well you did overall!
// This program makes a function that adds a specific number
function makeAdder(valueToAdd) {
    // This is the magic box. It takes a number and adds your special number to it
    return function (number) {
        return number + valueToAdd;
    };
}
// Making a magic box that adds 5
var addFive = makeAdder(5);
console.log(addFive(10)); // If we put 10 in the box, it gives us 15
// We made a function (magic box) that adds 5 to any number.
